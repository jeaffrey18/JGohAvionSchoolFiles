Variable is like a container that contains the answer to a question. So if i ask
you the question, instead of giving me the answer you will give me the container instead. 

Strings are the answers inside the container. 

Functions are the explanation for the answer inside the variable explaining the strings.
inside those functions we have an argument and a return. arguments are the topic of the
function while return supports the argument. 

if statements are examples for the answer inside the functions.

boolean values are two possible answers. can be a choice of true or false.
