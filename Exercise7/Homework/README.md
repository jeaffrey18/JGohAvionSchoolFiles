# Homework #JSIV

## Instructions

	* Objects
	* Properties
	* Methods
	* for in loop
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.

object['key'] = function(){}

  // return true if the user has a value for the property 'email'
  // otherwise return false
  /*let newUser = {
    email: null,
  }
  for (let email in newUser) {
    if (newUser[email] != null) {
     return true;
    }
    else {
     return false;
    }
  }
  return newUser;
