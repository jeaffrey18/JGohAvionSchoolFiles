            <h5> Singapore Hainanese Chicken Rice</h5>
            <span id=spanId>As a self proclaimed chef and food lover, there is only one food that makes my heart full and stomach satisfied.
            It's Singapores Hainanese Chicken rice. As a half Singaporean I pride my self with this exquisite food.
            The rice that is cooked with the chickens broth with some garlic, ginger and soy sauce makes it super tasty. The chicken on top
            of this rice, whether it's steamed or roasted, makes the whole plate a star. </span>
